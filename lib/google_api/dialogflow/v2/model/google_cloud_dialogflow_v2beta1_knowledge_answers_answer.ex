defmodule GoogleApi.Dialogflow.V2.Model.GoogleCloudDialogflowV2beta1KnowledgeAnswersAnswer do
  @moduledoc """
  An answer from Knowledge Connector.

  ## Attributes

  - answer (String.t): The piece of text from the &#x60;source&#x60; knowledge base document that answers this conversational query. Defaults to: `null`.
  - faqQuestion (String.t): The corresponding FAQ question if the answer was extracted from a FAQ Document, empty otherwise. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchConfidence (float()): The system&#39;s confidence score that this Knowledge answer is a good match for this converstational query, range from 0.0 (completely uncertain) to 1.0 (completely certain). Note: The confidence score is likely to vary somewhat (possibly even for identical requests), as the underlying model is under constant improvement, we may deprecate it in the future. We recommend using &#x60;match_confidence_level&#x60; which should be generally more stable. Defaults to: `null`.
  - matchConfidenceLevel (String.t): The system&#39;s confidence level that this knowledge answer is a good match for this conversational query. NOTE: The confidence level for a given &#x60;&lt;query, answer&gt;&#x60; pair may change without notice, as it depends on models that are constantly being improved. However, it will change less frequently than the confidence score below, and should be preferred for referencing the quality of an answer. Defaults to: `null`.
    - Enum - one of [MATCH_CONFIDENCE_LEVEL_UNSPECIFIED, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH]
  - source (String.t): Indicates which Knowledge Document this answer was extracted from. Format: &#x60;projects/&lt;Project ID&gt;/knowledgeBases/&lt;Knowledge Base ID&gt;/documents/&lt;Document ID&gt;&#x60;. Defaults to: `null`.
